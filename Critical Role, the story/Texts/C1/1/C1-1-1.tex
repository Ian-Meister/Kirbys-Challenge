\subsubsection{Arrival at Kraghammer}

\hfill %Fills first line, causes proper indention; DO NOT REMOVE

\huge \textsc{K}\normalsize raghammer's door guards had only begrudgingly let the mixed group of individuals through to the dwarven citadel along with several pointers and biting remarks, but only after showing their recently gifted paperwork and documents. It seemed a third time was a charm they wouldn't need, and neither would they need any illegal entry tactics. They made their way down the dark tunnels and alleyways towards the central portion of the city proper, witnessing an enormous underground metropolis sprawl out before them from their heightened vantage within the vacuous cave. Around them, the dark earth and shadows were crafted into beautiful stone work, marble columns, archways, and labyrinthine bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape. All of which was warmed with the glow of some strange crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source. A large metal forge enveloped the center of this three-tiered cylindrical city that had been built directly into the mountain itself.

A Tal'Dorei Council arcanist, Allura Vysoren, had helped the group gain the necessary papers to enter Kraghammer on the request that they locate and return to the safety of Tal'Dorei a questing halfling paladin of Bahamut, the platinum dragon. The paladin, a well-known and respected Lady Kima of Vord, was a long-time friend of the human woman Allura, and had essentially left on a vision quest as part of her development as a paladin. However, when speaking to the friends about her request Allura let the information go that a dark vision had come to her, saying that some sort of evil root was beginning to brood beneath Kraghammer and the mountains within. 

No matter the case of why they were headed back to Kraghammer, the majority of the group was happy to have simply made it out of an ambush of roaming barbarian goliaths while on the road to the dwarven citadel, even if it was by a major stroke of luck. In the middle of fighting the fellow goliaths who ambushed them, Grog someohow recognized one of them as a former ally of his own and ---for the first and only time anyone in the group could remember--- managed to talk his way out of a fight, but of course not until after both parties had traded scrapes and blows.

What they knew of Lady Kima's last actions and whereabouts was that she was headed into a mithral mine where the evil was supposedly brewing. They learned along the way that most of the mithral market within Kraghammer, along with an equal majority of the mithral mines themselves, were owned by the dwarven Lord Nostoc Greyspine; this being the only name they had with any definite ties to the deep earth quarry, they paused in the middle of the pathway overlooking the cavernous center of Kraghammer's cylindrical shape and began to argue over what to do. 

Scanlan spoke up first and inquisitively to his companions who all, including his fellow gnome, Pike, towered above him. ``We have to go find him, don't we?" Percival was the first to respond, opening his palms while looking back and forth between his companions behind his peculiarly shaped glasses.
    
``I think, before we do anything, we should find a place to sleep."

``That's true!" Tiberius bellowed and quickly agreed, turning his bespectacled and firey-red scaled head to face Percival.

Percival turned his head to face Tiberius as well, returning the agreement. ``Wouldn't it be nice to put everything down for a little while?" 

``Of course," Scanlan interjected while placing his hands on his hips and grinning. ``I have a lot of, uh ... \textit{booty} that I need to stow," at which several of his companions rolled their eyes and groaned at the carved and patterned ceiling of Kraghammer.

``I don't want to  ... hear about ... ughh..." Percival tilted back his head holding the bridge of his nose and sighed.

``Ha! Good way to phrase that, Scanlan." Tiberius complimented. ``Also," he added, returning his attention to the whole party, ``I would like to check out any kind of places where they might have enchanted libraries or whatnot." His dragonborn eyes slightly brightened with a small amount of excitement at the possibilities.

``Can---," Scanlan turned directly to Tiberius this time, ``Can you stay with us? You're the only one speaks Dwarvish."

``Yes, you are getting ahead of yourself." Vax'ildan commented, arms crossed.

``I'm just saying put it on the list!" Tiberius retorted with a hint of either annoyance or anger as he shrugged with his hands out.

Vax'ildan took a look around the area as he finished his part in the conversation and noticed two guards standing a small distance apart that were posted nearby wearing dark crimson and brass chest plates with a uniform scar carved across front that was actually a part of the design. The two guards were staring awkwardly at the colorful group arguing in the middle of one of Kraghammer's entry thoroughfares. Raising his hand in a slow swiping motion from Tiberius towards the two guards, Vax'ildan continued to stare back at the armored pair as he flatly spoke. 

``Tiberius, make with the dwarf-talk, please."

``Oh, uh---" Tiberius quickly stepped over to the dwarven pair, leaned down slightly and continued; ``Hello, friends." He  paused looking back and forth between the gaurds for just a moment before clearing his throat.``Ah-hrm... My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging for the night and a place of reputable ... reputation."

``You hear that, Jepson?" the dwarf closest to Tiberius shouted with a grin to the other. ``They're lookin' for a place to stay."

``Aye," the dwarf named Jepson shouted back. ``I heard that right. It's about time we had some \textit{new} folk in town." Jepson then looked to Tiberius who stood closer to his companion than himself. ``Well..." he said before turning and loudly answering in common-speak to the whole party, ``...if you're lookin' for a place to stay, I'd say your best bets would be the Pig Pits."

``Is that the \textit{name} of a place?" Scanlan asked worriedly as he slightly retracted at the name of such an establishment. 

``Yes!" replied Jepson with a self-satisfied grin that was kept well-hidden behind his beard. ``Certainly! The Pig Pits."

``Alright ..." Scanlan smiled worriedly, as Jepson continued; ``Ask for the Pig Pits---" before being cut off by Vax'ahlia.

``Those are \textit{actually} pig pits, aren't they?" she questioned while calmly stroking Trinket's fur with one of her hands. She looked immediately fed up with the dwarves for a moment as she asked, sure of the answer.

``I know, I feel like ... I feel like we're being hazed ... " Keyleth added shyly.

``What?! No!" Jepson drew out the length of the word `no' as if holding it would make it more convincing. ``Not at all." 

``That sounds alright with me." Grog said to none in particular, but Vax'ahlia turned and gave him a disapproving look none the less which he returned with a fully contented smile.

Finally, Scanlan got over his trepidation of the supposed name of a potential inn, and kindly asked; ``Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?"

``Pig Pits," the dwarf closer to Tiberius turned slightly, and pointed a hand over the ledge of the thoroughfare, ``are that way." He pointed to an area down past the central forge structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a large temple the enveloped the bottom floor of Kraghammer proper. There was indeed a very distant slop of mud where internal livestock were being kept for the city. A place to sleep, certainly, but not a welcome one.

At this, Vax'ahlia pulled a piece of gold from her pockets and held it pointed up between two fingers and her thumb with her eyes closed for a moment. ``Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud."

Still pointing down to the Pig Pits, the dwarf looked over his shoulder. ``Oooh ... " he said as he turned and happily grinned ear to ear, impressed with the half-elf woman before him. ``Well, it's good to see that at least one of you speaks dwarvish." Sauntering over to her, the dwarf took the coin, kinked it in his teeth, and sighed with a happily defeated tone as he pocketed the coin. ``All right," he began, ``if you're looking for a proper place to stay you're going to look for the Iron Hearth Tavern. That is just to your left, up about that way," he pointed upwards to his right, up an incline in the ground of this tier of the city, ``no more than half a mile. Keep an eye out. Listen for the laughter---" he shook his fingers around his ears in a pantomime of the noise as he said this, ``and the people who are \textit{very}, very drunk. That's your best bet"

``Thanks." Vax'ahlia responded.

``No worries." the said dwarf. He began to speak again, but she quickly added;

``I like your armor, by the way." after which she winked, accentuating herself as she did so, but it was lost on the dwarf.

``Well, thank you kindly." He replied, turning around and making the short walk back to his post as Tiberius walked past him to rejoin the group.

They continued to the western side of Kraghammer, up in the direction the dwarves had guided them. Curling around the central platform of the city, the group made way to a large and central tavern-inn that could be clearly seen from well down the road. Just as the dwarf had told them to listen for, music was being played, laughter and boastful cheer was flooding the streets that centered around this tavern, and several arguments could be heard from the distance of the several-buildings between them and their hopeful place of rest. It was apparent from the multide of people entering and exiting the flourishing tavern-inn the dwarves had told them of was a significant part of the social life here on this level of the city.

Scanlan's nose crinkled as he walked first into the bustling tavern. He took a sniff of the air before turning in the doorway and announcing to the group, ``Something \textit{smells} in here."

``Drinking territory," Grog said in an unusually matter-of-fact tone, still outside the tavern--- his incredible height kept his head above the doorway, so as they grew closer he was unable to see for himself how the inside of the tavern was, nor did he recieve the smells as strongly as his compatriots. 

Inside, loud, boisterous and hearty laughter dwarven laughter was accompanied by clinking drinks, and the scent that Scanlan had sampled began to reach the other party members of the group; the place smelled of stale alcohol and smoked wood of some kind. Grog placed a large gray hand on the upper beam of the door frame and leaned his large body downward to peer into the doorway and also got hit by the scent and scenes. 

``Yes!" Grog suddenly exclaimed in his gruff voice, as a large smile quickly spread across his face and his eye lit up with excitement.
